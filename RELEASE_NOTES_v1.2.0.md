# 🚀 KSE Memory SDK v1.2.0 - Community Edition Release

**Release Date**: June 19, 2025  
**Version**: 1.2.0  
**Status**: Production Ready for Community Sharing

## 🎯 What's New

### Zero-Config Quickstart Experience
Get hybrid AI search running in **30 seconds**:
```bash
pip install kse-memory-sdk
kse quickstart
# That's it! Working AI search with automatic backend detection
```

### Multiple Free Backend Options
No more API costs to get started:
- **ChromaDB**: Completely free, local, persistent storage
- **Weaviate Cloud**: Free tier with cloud hosting
- **Qdrant Cloud**: Free tier with managed service
- **In-Memory**: Perfect for testing and demos

### Intelligent Auto-Detection
The SDK now automatically:
- Detects available backends on your system
- Recommends the best option for your use case
- Installs missing dependencies
- Configures everything optimally

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Configuration System Overhaul
- **FIXED**: `'dict' object has no attribute 'backend'` error that was breaking quickstart
- **FIXED**: Proper configuration object creation after Pydantic-2 upgrade
- **FIXED**: All examples updated to use secure environment variables
- **FIXED**: Removed hardcoded API keys from documentation

## 🏗️ Production-Ready Infrastructure

### Docker Support
```bash
# Deploy the entire community stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.community.yml up
```

### Environment Variable Management
```bash
# Secure configuration with .env files
cp .env.example .env
# Edit with your API keys (optional for free backends)
```

### Enhanced CLI
```bash
# Interactive backend selection
kse setup

# Quick backend-specific setup
kse setup --backend chromadb
kse setup --backend weaviate
kse setup --backend qdrant
```

## 🔄 Migration from v1.1.x

### Automatic Migration
Most users won't need to change anything - the new version maintains full backward compatibility.

### Recommended Updates
```python
# OLD (still works, but deprecated)
config = KSEConfig(vector_store={"backend": "pinecone"})

# NEW (recommended)
config = KSEConfig.from_dict({"vector_store": {"backend": "pinecone"}})

# BEST (with environment variables)
# Set PINECONE_API_KEY in .env file
config = KSEConfig.from_dict({"vector_store": {"backend": "pinecone"}})
```
